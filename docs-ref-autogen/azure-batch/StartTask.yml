      A task which is run when a compute node joins a pool in the Azure

      Batch service, or when the compute node is rebooted or reimaged.


      Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute

      node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to)
      when

      an unhealthy compute node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to

      host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and
      are

      not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount
      is

      0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of
      this,

      all tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being

      interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate
      data.

      The best practice for long running tasks is to use some form of

      checkpointing.
