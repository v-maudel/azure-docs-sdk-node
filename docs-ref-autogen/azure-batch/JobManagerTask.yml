      Specifies details of a Job Manager task.


      The Job Manager task is automatically started when the job is created. The

      Batch service tries to schedule the Job Manager task before any other
      tasks

      in the job. When shrinking a pool, the Batch service tries to preserve

      compute nodes where Job Manager tasks are running for as long as possible

      (that is, nodes running 'normal' tasks are removed before nodes running
      Job

      Manager tasks). When a Job Manager task fails and needs to be restarted,
      the

      system tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle

      nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running tasks in the

      pool and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager

      task to restart. Note that a Job Manager task in one job does not have

      priority over tasks in other jobs. Across jobs, only job level priorities

      are observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 job needs to
      be

      restarted, it will not displace tasks of a priority 1 job. Batch will
      retry

      tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute node. Examples
      of

      recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy

      compute node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to host
      failure.

      Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted

      against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an

      internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all

      tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being

      interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate
      data.

      The best practice for long running tasks is to use some form of

      checkpointing.
