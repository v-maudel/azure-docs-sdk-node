      Updates the properties of the specified job schedule.


      This replaces only the job schedule properties specified in the request.
      For

      example, if the schedule property is not specified with this request, then

      the Batch service will keep the existing schedule. Changes to a job
      schedule

      only impact jobs created by the schedule after the update has taken place;

      currently running jobs are unaffected.

            The time interval

            schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time.
            Because

            a job schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given

            if it is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the

            is still running, the Batch service will not create the new job

            will be

            scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally

            a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use

            complete as

            /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.

            The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as
            the Azure

            Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP
            addresses to

            accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't
            have

            enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute

            must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based

            communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule

            has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication
            to the

            compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the
            Batch

            service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For
            pools

            created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks

            Groups

            (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound

            if it is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the

            The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as

            Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP

            Groups

            accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't
            have

            enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute
            nodes,

            and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service
            principal

            must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based
            Access

            Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet
            must allow

            communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule
            tasks on

            the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified
            VNet

            has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication
            to the

            compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the
            Batch

            service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For
            pools

            created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks

            ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools
            created

            with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks
            are

            supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security
            Groups

            (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound

            communication. For pools created with a virtual machine
            configuration,

            enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port
            3389 for

            Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration,
            enable ports

            10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure
            Storage

            on port 443. For more details see:

      This fully replaces all the updateable properties of the job schedule. For

      example, if the schedule property is not specified with this request, then

      the Batch service will remove the existing schedule. Changes to a job

      schedule only impact jobs created by the schedule after the update has

      place; currently running jobs are unaffected.

            Because

            a job schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given

            if it is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the

            is still running, the Batch service will not create the new job

            The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as
            the Azure

            Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP

            to the

            compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the
            Batch

            service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For

            Groups

            successfully after

            all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute node unusable,
            and

            will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be detected via
            the node

            state and failure info details. If false, the Batch service will not
            wait

            for the start task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start

            executing on the compute node while the start task is still running;
            and

            even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be
            scheduled on the

            node. The default is false.

            need to

            have empty data disks attached to them. This cannot be updated. Each

            /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.

            The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as
            the Azure

            Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP
            addresses to

            accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't

            must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based

            Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet

            communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule

            has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication
            to the

            compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the
            Batch

            service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For
            pools

            created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks

            supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security
            Groups

            (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound

            communication. For pools created with a virtual machine
